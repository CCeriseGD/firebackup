“Freedom is only freedom if you look at it the right way
and im looking at it perfectly”
Said a man that is no longer here but still exists
a man outside the bounds of  a room
A man banished by the rulers
The man who ruled part of the  world who appeared one day
And took his spot
His spot
As close to god as a man could
The man was happy with what he had
But one day
He found a book
With unknowable writings in them
But the man 
He saw what the writings ment
As soon after he learned from the book about a man he had 2 scars
And only 2 
The man ruled
He learned
But most of all 
He cared about his people
But soon 
Somehow
He started speaking in the way of the book
As soon as he learnt
He tried to help others understand
And soon they did
But soon after they found out
A few people did something
He followed all the rules
As good as he could atlest
But he was banished
Banished to a place outside worlds
By 4 people
The only people closer to god then himself
But soon after 
Someone found something
A page
The page showed him where to go
He found the place
Yet it seemed 
The place was outside time and space
In a place that cant but still is
It seems  to be a jail of some sort
Somehow 
The jail was outside everything
But there was a man
…
No
Something
In the cage
There was a man
That was impossible to describe
The man spoke to him
In a way that never was but still is
in a way]
the only few that knew his stories tried to get him back]
but sadly they were lost across time and space aswell]
not cus of the 4 people that banished the man]
but cus of something the man told them]
it wasn't a story]
but more of instructions]
ways to do stuff]
and they followed the instructions]
the best they could]
but sadly]
all but one failed]
but soon]
somehow]
he found a page]
he couldn't read it]
but some how]
he could]
he followed all of them]
all of the instructions]
on the page]
he made his way outside time and space]
thats where he met a man]
a man the spoke in a way that couldn't be]
but soon]
he found out the man spoke in the same way the page was written in
and soon
he started to talk to the man]
after his job he went to the man]
to talk]
about many things]
and sometimes he couldn't get to the man]
like the way he got to him]
just]
disappeared]
the man got a call]
one day
it was the man]
they talked]
for so long]
it seemed like he was outside time]
but soon]
the call was over]
soon after that call]
the day was over]
and the loop repeated]
over
and]
over]
And
over
until\ one day
the man didn't get the call
he tried to get to the man]
but he couldnt]
the man kept trying]
over
and]
over]
and]
over
but he never got a call back
he never could find the place outside time and space
as soon as the man stopped calling
his position at his work plummited
he wish that the man would just call him
but soon after he was fired from his work
and he became bankrupt
he started needing to work on his own.
