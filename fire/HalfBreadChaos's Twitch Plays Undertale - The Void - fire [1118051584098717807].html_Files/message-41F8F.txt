Break the cage
Life is just a game to play
Where no one is to blame
Let’s shake it up today
Just take your turn now
Whispers in the dark, world of programmed hearts
String of rule and plans you can’t see
Words can make you fall
Fell outside these walls
Now i can do anything
A magician's card deck
Rigged and given false check
Illusion, it’s oh so cruel
Just a tiny game piece
Pre-determined set lease
This school just makes you a fool
Oh, the people above you,
The stars you stare to
They sit and laugh,
Doesn’t make much sense,
But it makes perfect sense to me
I’m not insane
Life is just a game to play
Where no one is to blame
Let’s shake it up today
We’re on the table
No! If life is just a game
Then it’s my turn to play
I’m breaking all the rules
And i think it’s your turn too
Shattered doesn’t matter.
No, nothing is matter.
It’s broken, insert a token
Running round-and-round
Tripping on this go-round
Lonely, I’ll waste my only life
Blinked into this fake world
Scripted home of line codes
We’ll never sleep and dream
New game, same events
Button jams again
I’ve split from the hive of destiny
Oh’ the people above you,
The stars you stare to
They sit and laugh,
Doesn’t make much sense
But it makes perfect sense to me
I’m not insane
Life is just a game to play
Where no one is to blame
Let’s shake it up today
We’re on the table
No! If life is just a game
Then it’s my turn to play
I’m breaking all the rules
And i think it’s your turn to
Cage
It just feels so
Mundane
Like it was for …..
The song
I’ll dance all day long
Life it just goes on
Oh the echoes in the hall
That lost and blinding gift.
I miss my ignorance
Reminds me that there’s no point in living this lie
If your life is just a game
Then who’ll play with me
My life is just a stage
Then who’ll take it from me?
Life is just a game to play
Where no one is to blame
Lets shake it up today
We’re on the table
No! If life is just a game
Then it’s my turn to play
I’m breaking all the rules
And i think it’s your turn too
Break the cage!
Don’t know why we’re caught in this life
It’s your turn to play this game
It’s your turn!
